<h2 id="the-definition-of-higher-level-ai">The definition of Higher Level AI</h2>
<p>In several science fiction movies and stories we read about a scientist or a hacker fiddling with his computer at night who falls asleep only to wake up in the morning to find out that he accidentally built something with consciousness, or, whatever he was working on since ages suddenly became something different. And he reads on the screen of his computer a line that he doesn&#39;t remember typing: &quot;Who am I?&quot;</p><p>The perception that we have for an truly intelligent being is someone who is like us, talks like us and asks the questions that we have asked ourselves for millennia. Books and movies have made us fantasize about man-made sentient beings who dream, love and get angry. </p>
<h3 id="consciousness-and-existential-dilemma">Consciousness and Existential Dilemma</h3>
<p>Is the meaning of an AI of higher order only that it gains consciousness according to the definition that we have made over time? We believe that there will be a point in time when the artificially created intelligence will become aware of its own existence, start asking questions, and that will be the beginning of what humanity has waited for long. But is it because that is the extent to which human imagination can go: An artificially created entity that asks the question &#39;Who am I?&#39; or &#39;What is the meaning of my existence&#39;. Do animals have existential angst? Do they ask the question &#39;What is the meaning of my existence&#39;? We actually do not know but this definition of consciousness does seem very limited. A conscious being might as well be asking a completely different question. Or they many not ask any questions at all - they might just be at peace with their being. Imagine a super intelligent being housed in a giant data center silently humming for 50 years - not needing or wanting to do anything other than, well, just humming!</p><p>This question is becoming increasingly important because our technological capacity to create complex systems is exponentially increasing and it wont&#39; be long before we create something for which we&#39;ll need to decide whether we can call it conscious or not. And maybe, that is not the right question. Maybe we&#39;ll have to accept that between the black and white, there could be some gray. </p>
